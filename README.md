Player vs Computer.
The player has to input a number between 1 and 10
if the computer guesses the number, the player is out. 
The player has to do the same thing and try and guess the number the computer chooses.
Everytime the bowler is unable to guess the batsmen's number, those many runs are added to the score. 
This is an adaptation of the Hand Cricket game.
